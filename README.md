# Deezium

An alternative open-source lightweight graphical front-end for [Deezer](https://deezer.com).

## Currently alpha!

This application is currently in alpha state! It is just open source to provide the ability to report bugs and help me with coding.

## How to install

**Currently you don't**, if you don't like to tinker arround.

As this is in alpha state, I'm not providing installation instructions.
