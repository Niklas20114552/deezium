# Deezium

An alternative open-source lightweight graphical front-end for [Deezer](https://deezer.com).

## Currently early release!

This application is currently in an early release state!
Not every important feature of the official deezer app is already present.

Also not every button does something currently.

## How to install

### Linux/macOS (or PearOS)

**Currently you don't**, if you don't like to tinker arround.

As this is in alpha state, I'm not providing installation instructions.

### Windows

See the releases tab on the sidebar.
